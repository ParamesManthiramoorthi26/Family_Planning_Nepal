# Predicting Men's Family Planning Preferences in Nepal Using Machine Learning

1. Introduction
Family planning is a crucial factor in population control and health policy. Understanding men’s preferences towards fertility and family planning can help governments and organizations develop effective policies.This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict men’s
family planning preferences based on survey data from Nepal.

*2. Problem Statement*
The project aims to analyze and predict men's family planning preferences using demographic
and survey-related features. By applying machine learning techniques, we can identify patterns
and help policymakers make informed decisions.
